This directory provides the supplementary figures for the work on the Comparative Analysis of Contemporary Satellite Radar-Altimetry Derived Freeboards for Antarctic Sea-Ice.
In this work, we compare the currently most comprehensive satllite-derived freeboards for the Antarctic sea-ice, which include LEGOS, CCI (ESA Climate Change Initiative), CSAO (CryoSat+ Antarctic Ocean) and Cryo-TMEPO.
